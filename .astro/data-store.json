What if you could watch evolution happen right before your eyes? Enter Axols, a captivating evolution simulation that brings the process of natural selection to life on your computer screen.\n\nAxols is a Go-based project that simulates the life and evolution of particle-like creatures called \"axols\" in a 2D environment. Using the Pixel game library, it creates a visually engaging representation of these digital lifeforms as they navigate their world, seek food, and evolve over generations.\n\n## Key Features of Axols\n\n1. **Two Distinct Species**: The simulation starts with two different types of axols, each with their own unique properties. This diversity sets the stage for interesting evolutionary paths.\n\n2. **Food-Seeking Behavior**: Axols aren't just wandering aimlessly. They actively seek out food sources within their sensory range, mimicking real-world foraging behaviors.\n\n3. **Generational Evolution**: Every 10 seconds, a new generation is born. The most successful axols (those who consumed the most food) get to pass on their traits, driving the evolution of the population.\n\n4. **Mutation and Crossover**: Just like in nature, axols' offspring inherit traits from their parents, but with the possibility of mutations. This genetic variation is the fuel for evolution.\n\n5. **Visual Representation**: Each axol is beautifully rendered with a translucent body, a nucleus, and a wiggling tail. It's not just data - you can actually see the creatures moving and evolving!\n\nWhat makes Axols particularly interesting is how it simplifies complex evolutionary concepts into a visually appealing and easy-to-understand format. Whether you're a biology enthusiast, a coding aficionado, or just someone curious about the mechanics of life, Axols offers a unique and engaging experience.\n\nWhile the project is still evolving (pun intended!), with plans for multiple biomes and more complex evolutionary mechanisms, it already provides a fascinating glimpse into the world of digital life simulations.\n\nSo why not give it a try? Clone the repository, run the simulation, and watch as generations of axols adapt and evolve before your eyes. Who knows - you might just gain a new perspective on the intricate dance of life and evolution!","src/content/petals/07-axols/index.mdx","eef494440f0b27ce","07-axols/index.mdx","08-project-1",{"id":77,"data":79,"body":87,"filePath":88,"digest":89,"legacyId":90,"deferredRender":26},{"title":80,"description":81,"date":82,"demoURL":83,"repoURL":84,"image":85,"draft":21},"Gedachte - RealTime Chat. 💭","Gedachte - msgs in a bottle. to be revisited soon. 💭","10/21/2019","https://gedachte.netlify.app","https://github.com/SourceAura/gedachte",{"src":86,"alt":80},"/images/gedachte.png","![Gedachte](/images/gedachte.png)\n\nGedachte - ...share the essence of imagination. 💭\n[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/237cf08f-b1e8-4789-843e-89a0a3506ca3/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/gedachte/deploys)","src/content/petals/08-project-1/index.mdx","50e68580b13d83b1","08-project-1/index.mdx","99-draft",{"id":91,"data":93,"body":99,"filePath":100,"digest":101,"rendered":102,"legacyId":111},{"title":94,"description":95,"date":96,"demoURL":17,"repoURL":18,"image":97,"draft":26},"Draft example","Setting draft flag to true to hide this post.","2022-12-31",{"src":98,"alt":94},"/images/draft.png","![Draft](/images/draft.png)\n\n\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
